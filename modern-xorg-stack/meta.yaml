# This single package includes a fairly complete X11 stack. This is needed
# because Gtk+ 3 requires XInput version 2, which is not availabe on
# RHEL/CentOS 5, and (shockingly) there are machines out there still stuck
# on that ancient OS.

# HACK: the current (8.5.18-0) version of `tk` on OS X includes some random
# X11 headers. To build we need Python which means we need tk, so tk's headers
# take precedence when the package is generated -- so, for instance, our
# package cannot contain include/X11/Xlib.h. We use a post-link script to work
# around this in horrible fashion. See
# https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/600 .
